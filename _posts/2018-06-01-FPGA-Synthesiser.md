## Introduction

This is a final project of course *EE332 Design of Digital System*. The aim of the course is to teach VHDL, as well as the processing of designing a digital system, based on the knowledge of digital circuits.

For the lab work, the course uses *Nexys 4 DDR* develop board, and *Vivado* as the software.

Here is a simple video about how our program works:
