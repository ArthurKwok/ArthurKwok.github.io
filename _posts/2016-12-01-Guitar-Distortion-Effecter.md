## Introduction

This is a final project of course *EE201 Analog Circuit*. We made a analog guitar effecter, based on the classic pedal *Ibanez TubeScreamer 808*, as well as testing, simulation and circuit analysis.

## Design

We found a blue print of the pedal circuit on the internet, and done the layout process by ourselves. Then, we bought some spetial potentiometers and capacitors, and done the soldering process.

After finished the model, we test the circuit and done some simulation with *MultiSim*.
